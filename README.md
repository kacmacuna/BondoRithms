*(Double)Linked List - 
   In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements,
   whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each
   element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes
   which together represent a sequence.
   
*Binary Search Tree -
  In computer science, binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees,
  are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. 
  They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items,
  or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key.
